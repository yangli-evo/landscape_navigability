# Landscape Navigability using gene expression fitness proxy 
This repository provides code and analysis pipelines for studying **adaptive landscape navigability** and **epistasis** using gene expression levels in yeast.

## üåê Background
Adaptive (fitness) landscapes describe the mapping between genotypes and phenotypes or fitness.  
This project focuses on **gene expression landscapes**, using transcriptomic and proteomic data from 16 yeast genotypes (wild type + 15 auxotrophic mutants).  

Key scientific questions:  
- How navigable are gene expression landscapes when altered by **trans-regulatory mutations**?  
- How does navigability differ between **mRNA** and **protein** expression landscapes?  
- What role does **epistasis** play in shaping accessibility to global optima?  
- How do empirical landscapes compare to **maximally rugged landscapes** and **cis-regulatory (TF binding affinity) landscapes**?


### Global Optimal Navigability
- **Preprocessing:** Normalization and filtering of gene expression levels.  
- **Fitness Landscape Modeling:** Constructing landscapes based on expression levels and fitness values.  
- **Navigability Analysis:** Assessing pathway accessibility between fitness peaks.

### Epistasis

This repository also contains code for analyzing and classifying **epistasis** between genetic interactions based on fitness data. It computes the epistasis value `Œµ` and classifies the type of epistasis based on the results.


Epistasis refers to the interaction between different genetic loci that influence an organism's fitness. The goal of this project is to analyze genetic interactions and classify them into different categories such as **Reciprocal Sign Epistasis (RSE)**, **Simple Sign Epistasis (SSE)**, **Positive Epistasis (PE)**, and **Negative Epistasis (NE)**.

### **Epistasis Calculation Formula**

The epistasis value `Œµ` is calculated using the following formula:

$$
\epsilon = ln E_{AB} - ln E_{aB} - ln E_{Ab} + ln E_{ab}
$$

Where:
- E<sub>AB</sub> is the fitness value of the genotype with both alleles.
- E<sub>aB</sub> and E<sub>Ab</sub> represent the fitness values of the other genotypes formed by different allele combinations.
- E<sub>ab</sub> is the fitness value of widetype genotype.

The program computes this value for all combinations of genetic variants and classifies the interactions based on the significance of `Œµ`.
